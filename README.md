# Feedr Technical Challenge

For the Feedr Challenge I decided to use TypeScript to build a strong typed application. I also chose to work in a TDD
environment by creating the tests for each part I create first before building the solution. I also added Airbnb linting 
for TS and React for a tidy and consistent code base.

I started out by creating my own custom hook called `useMenu`, this is where all the functionality is controlled for the menu
and returns `MenuHookInterface`.

I then started separating each component I felt necessary
